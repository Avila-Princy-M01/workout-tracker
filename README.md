## Backend API

The backend is a Flask REST API. Main endpoints:

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` ‚Äî Returns API status.

### Workouts
- `GET /api/workouts?limit=<n>` ‚Äî List all workouts (optionally limit results)
- `POST /api/workouts` ‚Äî Add a new workout
- `GET /api/workouts/<id>` ‚Äî Get a specific workout by ID
- `DELETE /api/workouts/<id>` ‚Äî Delete a workout by ID

#### Example: Add Workout
```json
POST /api/workouts
{
  "type": "strength",
  "duration_minutes": 60,
  "exercises": [
    {"name": "Bench Press", "type": "strength", "sets": 4, "reps": 8, "weight_kg": 60},
    {"name": "Running", "type": "cardio", "distance_km": 5}
  ],
  "notes": "Felt strong today!"
}
```

### Statistics
- `GET /api/stats` ‚Äî Returns workout stats (totals, averages, last 30 days, types)

---

## Frontend Usage
- **Add Workout:** Fill out the form, add exercises, and save.
- **View Workouts:** Browse, filter, and delete past workouts.
- **Statistics:** See totals, averages, and breakdowns by type.

---

## Data Format

Workouts are stored in `workouts.json` (auto-created). Example entry:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "date": "2024-06-01T10:00:00",
  "type": "strength",
  "duration_minutes": 60,
  "exercises": [
    {"name": "Bench Press", "type": "strength", "sets": 4, "reps": 8, "weight_kg": 60},
    {"name": "Running", "type": "cardio", "distance_km": 5}
  ],
  "notes": "Felt strong today!",
  "total_calories": 390
}
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Cannot connect to backend:** Ensure you started the Flask server (`python apis.py`).
- **CORS errors:** The backend enables CORS for local development. If you change ports, update `API_BASE` in `front.html`.
- **Data not saving:** Check for write permissions in the project directory.
- **Port in use:** Change the port in `apis.py` if 5000 is occupied.
